            Iâ€™m a front-end developer with a passion for technology and a drive 
            to create engaging and responsive user interfaces. I graduated with a first-class 
            degree in artificial intelligence from Multimedia University, where I gained a solid 
            foundation in programming and a deep understanding of how technology can transform 
            our world. I believe technology is more than just a tool, it's a magical gateway to 
            endless possibilities and a symbol of our wildest dreams and aspirations. Technology is
            the closest thing we have to fairytales and a beacon of hope for a brighter future.

            My web development journey began in 2018 when I experimented with Shopify and WordPress 
            to build e-commerce sites. However, I soon realized the challenges of customizing prebuilt 
            templates to fit my exact needs. This roadblock fueled my determination to build websites 
            from scratch, with a focus on crafting mobile-responsive designs that deliver an efficient 
            and intuitive user experience. I am committed to delivering high-quality code that meets the 
            needs of my clients and users, and I stay up-to-date with the latest tech developments.
